                      EXAMPLE IV

             Routine for Clearing Memory


Object:  Clear memory, including 20 long lines, 4 short lines,
         MQ, ID, and PN registers, IP flip-flop, AR, and
         overflow indicator.

         Also, use compact coding to make program as short as
         possible.

Operation: Read program tape with p, then Compute to GO.  Program
         operates in line 23.  Execution time is 2.5 seconds.

Coding:  .00   .02.05.0.29.28       Clear AR
         .01  u.12.15.2.23.23       Executed at .05.  Line 23 is
         .02  u.16.10.0.27.29         precessed by one word to the
         .03   .06.10.0.26.31         form show below.  Also AR
                                      is exchanged with 23.03.



Revised form of line 23 after precession.

         .00         .06.10.0.26.31    Add 3 to destination of
                                       command in AR by means of
                                       3-bit shift tally.

         .01         .02.05.0.29.28    No longer used.

         .10 (.02)  u.12.15.2.23.23    Exchange AR with 23.03, then
                                       execute 23.03 at word .15.

         .15 (.03)  u.00.00.0.00.00    Ship to .00
                         or
                    u.16.10.0.SS.DD    Copy SS to line DD

The SS.DD combination in .03 takes on the following values:

     28.00  Clear Line 00        29.13
     28.03    (AR is clear)      29.16
     28.06                       29.19
     28.09                       29.22
     28.12                       29.25  ID and PN, IP
     28.15                       29.28
     28.18                       29.31  Turn off overflfow indicator
     28.21                       30.02  Line 21 has been cleared
     28.24  MQ                   30.05  so Source 30 = 0
     28.27  ar = 0, no test      30.08
     28.30                       30.11
     29.01  Source 29 = 0        30.14
     29.04                       30.17
     29.07                       30.20
     29.10                       30.23  Clear out program.
