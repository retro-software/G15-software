G-15 paper tape image files from Paul's web site, http://www.piercefuller.com/collect/bendix/.

These files are binary paper tape images with each tape frame represented as one 8-bit byte in the file. The fifth (high-order) bit of the tape frame is in the low-order bit of the byte. A [script that converts these images](https://github.com/pkimpel/retro-g15/blob/master/software/tools/Pierce-Paper-Tape-Decoder.html) to the ASCII tape image format used in this repository is available.

Some of these files were converted to the ASCII format by Paul Kimpel using the script mentioned above and have been placed at other locations in this repository, e.g., `BXTST.pti` in the Diagnostics/ folder and `TQ.pti` in the TQ/ folder.
