G-15 paper tape image files from David Green's first-generation computers web site, particularly https://www.uraone.com/computers/FirstGen/ and https://www.uraone.com/computers/bendixg15/.

These files are ASCII paper tape images with extension .PTI and are in the standard format used by this repository.

Two alternate file types are also included, the following name extensions:

  * `.G15` -- Annotated disassemblies of the raw machine code in a numeric format similar to that used by the PPR program.

  * `.DMI` -- Disassemblies of the raw machine code in numeric format, with the command words also shown in their hexadecimal and fractional binary representations.

Not all object programs/routines are in all three formats.

Some of these files in executable form can be found in other folders in this repository, e.g., `G15TAPE` in the Diagnostics/ folder and `PPR` in the PPR/ folder.
