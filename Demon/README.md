# Demon

Program to compute a two-dimensional cyclic cellular automaton written by Lucien Baumann in early 2024 and generously donated to the G-15 project. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_cellular_automaton).

In submitting the program, he wrote:

    Here is the output after 30 generations (one generation runs in about 10 minutes).

    It's kind of hard to see the demons (spirals) without colors... You can change the random seed at line 1, word 24.

Files:

## demon.pti

An executable tape image with included (French) commented source code for the demon program. This image is not bootable. You should have previously initialized the system using a tape that contains the number track.

## demon-English.pti

The same file as `demon.pti` but with the comments translated from French to English using Google Translate.

## demon-Disassembly.txt

A disassembly of the tape image generated by https://github.com/pkimpel/retro-g15/blob/master/software/tools/Paper-Tape-Disassembler.html.

## Demon-Output-14.6hours.txt

The typewriter output from the program after running for 14.6 hours in the retro-g15 emulator. The left-most 56 columns are the raw output of the program. The right-most 28 columns are the same as those on the left, but with the digits from the left manually translated to characters of varying visible density (1:`.`, 2:`-`, 3:`=`, 4:`+`, 5:`*`, 6:`/`, 7:`@`, 8:`#`). The rows of periods between the grids are output by the program to show its progress as it computes the next iteration.

The output starts as quite random, but about half-way through this example, it begins to coalesce into a discernable pattern.
